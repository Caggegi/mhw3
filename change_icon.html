    <h1>Kigali</h1>
    <p>Kigali (Kinyarwanda pronunciation: [Ki.ɡɑ́.ɾi]) is the capital and largest city of Rwanda. It is near the nation's geographic centre in a region of rolling hills, with a series of valleys and ridges joined by steep slopes. The city has been Rwanda's economic, cultural, and transport hub since it became the capital following independence from Belgian rule in 1962.

        In an area controlled by the Kingdom of Rwanda from the 17th century and then by the German Empire, the city was founded in 1907 when Richard Kandt, the colonial resident, chose the site for his headquarters, citing its central location, views and security. Foreign merchants began to trade in the city during the German era, and Kandt opened some government-run schools for Tutsi Rwandan students. Belgium took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, forming the mandate of Ruanda-Urundi. Kigali remained the seat of colonial administration for Rwanda but Ruanda-Urundi's capital was at Usumbura (now Bujumbura) in Burundi and Kigali remained a small city with a population of just 6,000 at the time of independence.
        
        Kigali grew slowly during the following decades. It was not initially directly affected by the Rwandan Civil War between government forces and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which began in 1990. However, in April 1994 Rwanda's president Juvénal Habyarimana was killed when his aircraft was shot down near Kigali. His death was followed by the Rwandan genocide, with Hutu extremists loyal to the interim government killing an estimated 500,000–800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu nationwide. The RPF resumed fighting, ending a cease-fire of more than a year. They gradually took control of most of the country and seized Kigali on 4 July 1994. Post-genocide Kigali has experienced rapid population growth, with much of the city rebuilt.
        
        The city of Kigali is one of the five provinces of Rwanda, with boundaries set in 2006. It is divided into three districts—Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge—which historically had control of significant areas of local governance. Reforms in January 2020 transferred much of the districts' power to the city-wide council. The city also hosts the main residence and offices of the president of Rwanda and most government ministries. The largest contributor to Kigali's gross domestic product is the service sector, but a significant proportion of the population works in agriculture including small-scale subsistence farming. Attracting international visitors is a priority for city authorities, including leisure tourism, conferences and exhibitions.

        The name Kigali comes from the Kinyarwanda prefix ki- combined with the adjective suffix -gali, which means wide or broad. This was originally applied to Mount Kigali, most likely because the mountain itself was broad and wide, with the city later being named after the mountain.[3] According to Rwandan oral history, the name originated in the 14th century.[4] Rwandan scholar Alexis Kagame, who did extensive research into the country's oral history and traditions,[5] wrote that the name Kigali came into use after King Cyilima I Rugwe completed a conquest of the area. The legend states that Rugwe viewed the territory from the top of a hill and said burya iki gihugu ni kigali, which translates to "this country is vast".[4]

        Pre-colonial period
        The earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled the area between 8000 and 3000 BC and remain in the country today.[6][7] They were followed between 700 BC and AD 1500 by a number of Bantu groups, including the Hutu and Tutsi, who began clearing forests for agriculture.[7][8] According to oral history, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded in the 14th century on the shores of Lake Muhazi, around 40 kilometres (25 mi) east of modern Kigali.[9][10][11][12] The early kingdom included Kigali but it was a small state at this point in its history with larger and more powerful neighbours, Bugesera and Gisaka.[13][14] A member of the Gisaka dynasty killed Rwanda's king Ruganzu I Bwimba in the 16th century, but Ruganzu's son Cyilima I Rugwe fought back with help from Bugesera and was able to expand Rwanda's territory.[15] In the late 16th or early 17th century, the kingdom of Rwanda was invaded from the north by the Banyoro of modern-day Uganda.[15] The king was forced to flee westward, leaving Kigali and eastern Rwanda in the hands of Bugesera and Gisaka.[10][14] The formation of a new Rwandan dynasty in the 17th century by the mwami (king), Ruganzu II Ndoli, followed by eastward invasions and the conquest of Bugesera, marked the beginning of the Rwandan kingdom's dominance in the area.[16] The capital of the kingdom was at Nyanza, in the south of the country.[17]

        The founding of Kigali is generally dated to 1907, when German administrator and explorer Richard Kandt was appointed as the first resident of Rwanda, and established the city as the headquarters.[18][19][20] Alexis Kagame promoted an alternative theory that the city was established as a capital under Cyilima I Rugwe in either the 1300s or the 1500s. There is little direct evidence for this, however, and the more recent kings of the pre-colonial era are known to have been based at Nyanza.[20] Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi had been assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884,[21] forming part of German East Africa, and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king, Yuhi V Musinga.[22] Kandt arrived in 1899, to explore Lake Kivu and search for the source of the Nile.[23]

        When Germany decided in 1907 to separate the administration of Rwanda from that of Burundi, Kandt was appointed as resident.[24] He chose to make his headquarters in Kigali due to its central location in the country,[25] and also because the site on Nyarugenge Hill afforded good views and security.[25] Kandt's house, located close to the central business district (CBD), was the first European-style house in the city,[4] and remains in use today as the Kandt House Museum of Natural History.[26] Despite a German ordinance written in 1905, which prohibited "non-indigenous natives" from entering Rwanda,[27] Kandt began permitting the entry of foreign traders in 1908, which allowed commercial activity to begin in Rwanda.[28][27] Kigali's first businesses were established by Greek and Indian merchants,[28] with assistance from Baganda and Swahili people.[29] Items traded included cloth and beads.[29] Commercial activity was limited and there were only around 30 firms in the city by 1914.[30] Kandt also opened government-run schools in Kigali, which began educating Tutsi students.[31]

        Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, with Kigali being captured by the Northern Brigade led by Colonel Philippe Molitor on 6 May 1916.[32] The Belgians were granted sovereignty by a League of Nations mandate in 1922, forming the mandatory territory of Ruanda-Urundi.[33] In early 1917, Belgium attempted to assert direct rule on the mandate, placing King Musinga under arrest and sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary.[34] In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside Gisenyi.[35] An agricultural-labour shortage caused by the recruitment of locals to assist the European armies during the war, the plundering of food by soldiers, and torrential rains which destroyed crops, led to a severe famine at the start of the Belgian administration.[36] The famine, combined with the difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, prompted the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917.[37] Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration.[38][39] This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s,[40] but from 1924 the Belgians began once more to sideline the monarchy, this time permanently.[41] Belgium took over control of dispute resolution, appointment of officials and collection of taxes.[40][42] Kigali remained relatively small through the remainder of the colonial era, as much of the administration took place in Ruanda-Urundi's capital Usumbura, now known as Bujumbura in Burundi. Usumbura's population exceeded 50,000 during the 1950s and was the mandate's only European-style city,[43] while Kigali's population remained at around 6,000 until independence in 1962.[25]

        Post-independence era
        Kigali became the capital upon Rwandan independence in 1962.[44][18] Two other cities were considered: Nyanza, as the traditional seat of the mwami, and the southern city of Butare (known as Astrida under the Belgians), due to its prominence as a centre of intellect and religion.[45] The authorities eventually chose Kigali because of its more central location. The city grew steadily during the following decades; in the early 1970s the population was 25,000 with only five paved roads, and by 1991 it was around 250,000.[46] On 5 July 1973 there was a bloodless military coup, in which minister of defence Juvénal Habyarimana overthrew ruling president Grégoire Kayibanda.[47] Military officers had gathered in Kigali for a military tattoo to commemorate Independence Day a few days earlier, and they began occupying government buildings from dawn on 4 July.[48] Businesses closed for a few days, and troops patrolled across the city,[49] but the coup was bloodless and life continued as normal, historian Gérard Prunier describing the reaction as "widespread popular relief".[50] According to a US Department of State diplomatic cable sent shortly afterwards, the disruption following the coup was short-lived and the army had left the streets by 11 July.[51]

        Kigali was not directly affected during the first three years of the 1990–1994 Rwandan Civil War, although the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) did come close to attacking the city in February 1993.[52] In December of the same year, following the signing of the Arusha Accords, a United Nations peacekeeping force was established in the city, and the RPF were granted use of a building in the city for their diplomats and soldiers.[53] In April 1994 President Habyarimana was assassinated when his plane was shot down near Kigali International Airport. Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was also killed in the attack.[54] This was the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, in which 500,000–800,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government.[55][56] Opposition politicians based in Kigali were killed on the first day of the genocide,[57] and the city then became the setting for fierce fighting between the army and the RPF including at the latter's base.[58] The RPF began attacking from the north of the country, and gradually took control of most of Rwanda between April and June.[59] After encircling Kigali and cutting off its supply routes,[60] they began fighting for the city itself in mid-June.[61] The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically,[61] and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali.[61] The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July,[62] a date now commemorated as Liberation Day, a Rwandan national holiday.[63]

        Since the war and genocide the city has experienced rapid population growth as a result of migration from other areas, as well as a high birth rate.[64] Buildings that were heavily damaged during the fighting have been demolished, much of the city has been rebuilt, and modern office buildings and infrastructure now exist across the city. A masterplan, adopted by the city and the government in 2013 and supported by international finance and labour, seeks to establish Kigali as a decentralised modern city by 2040.[65] The development has been accompanied by forced eviction of residents in informal housing zones, however, and groups such as Human Rights Watch have accused the government of removing poor people and children from the city's streets and moving them to detention centres.[66][67]
